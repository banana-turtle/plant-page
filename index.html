<h1> Information on the wildlife along the Belmont Slough</h1>
  <p>On this page you can find more information than searching on Google and opening a lot of pages. Here you can find all the animals and plants on around the Belmont Slough. Common and endangered animals and plants are shown as Common and Endangered under the column of the animal. Hope you learn something about the amazing nature surrounding Oracle and Design Tech High School.</p>
  <p> Enjoy everyone!!!</p>
  
  
  <h2>Common Animals</h2>
    <h3>Bat Ray</h3>

      <h4>Bat Ray 
      Myliobatis Californica</h4>

      <p>The Bat Ray, a member of the eagle ray(Myliobatidae) family, can be found on the bottoms of sandy bays, in kelp forests, and in sloughs stretching from the Oregon coast to the Gulf of California.  Brown to almost black in color, the bat ray can be best identified by its bat-like pectoral fins, used to detect the pulses of water expelled by the sand’s underlying prey. Its diet consists mainly of small fishes, mollusks, and crustaceans, some of which the ray obtains by digging steep holes in the sand with its snout and pectoral fins. Bat rays also have venomous barbs on their tails, which they use to defend themselves. As you hike along the Bay Trail, you may see these rays skimming the surface of the slough, their dark wingtips breaking the water’s surface.</p>

       <h4>White-Tailed Kite</h4>
        <p>The White-Tailed Kite is a medium-sized hawk with a white body and long, narrow wings It’s found in a wide variety of open areas across North America, such as open woodlands, marshes, and fields. The kite can often be identified by its dark plumage and habit of hovering eighty feet over its prey while hunting. Its diet consists of mostly small rodents, including house mice, rats, and young rabbits. The White-Tailed Kite used to be rare and endangered, but their numbers have been increasing recently as they spread to new areas. They can be seen in Northern California year round.</p>

  <h2>Endangered Animals</h2>
      <h3>Ridgway’s Rail ( Formerly California Clapper Rail)</h3>
        <img src="http://ww2.kqed.org/science/wp-content/uploads/sites/35/2014/08/5281230537_4ecb9b4999_z.jpg" width="380" hight="400">
        <h3>California Ridgeway’s Rail 
        Rallus Obsoletus, Formerly California Clapper Rail</h3>

         <p>The California Ridgeway’s Rail is an endangered bird species found in tidal marshes throughout San Francisco Bay Area. Approximately the size of a chicken, it rarely flies, instead spending most of its life walking and running concealed by dense marsh vegetation. The bird has olive brown plumage, rust colored underside, and a long, slightly curved beak. As its diet consists mostly of fish, insects, invertebrates, and crustaceans such as crabs and clams, it forages the mud for its prey. Named in honor of bird scientist Robert Ridgeway, its numbers had been declining rapidly throughout the 2000s due to the loss of 90 percent of its Bay Area habitat from human land development. Other potential threats include predatory birds and climate change, which will contribute to yet even more habitat loss in years to come. Mercury and selenium from human contamination have been found in their eggs as well,  and so embryo mortality may also be a factor in their decline.</p> 

         <ul>
           <h4>Quick Facts:</h4>
             <li>Length: 13-19 inches</li>
             <li>Lifespan: unknown</li>
             <li>Entire lives spent in salt marshes</li>
             <li>Used to be widely hunted game birds</li>
             <li>Predators: Non native red fox subspecies, predatory birds such as hawks, Norway rats, house cats</li>

         <p>Family: Rallidae</p>

         <h4>WHAT YOU CAN DO TO HELP</h4>
         
        <ul>
         <li>Support tidal marsh restoration</li>
           <ol><li>South Bay Salt Pond Restoration Project, which aims to restore over 15,100 acres of former salt ponds to a diversity of habitat types to benefit all birds, including tidal marsh-dependent species.</li></ol>
         <li>Control pollution</li>
           <ol><li>Eliminate trash on the trail</li></ol>
         <li>Predators</li>
           <ol><li>Keep cats indoors</li></ol>
        </ul>

        <p>There are many things you can do to protect birds. Visit our national pages on migratory bird conservation. See What You Can Do to Help Wildlife and Plants (PDF) for more ideas.
Keep your cat inside. Cats kill millions of birds per year. Even well-fed cats kill birds. It is just their nature to hunt. Living indoors is also much safer for the cats themselves.
When you go to the beach, pay attention to signs warning you that birds are nesting. Many shore birds nest right on the beach. They are easily disturbed. Don't let your dog chase or bark at them.<!-- Jane will do this--></p>
      
      <h3>Salt Marsh Harvest Mouse</h3>
         <img src="http://www.wra-ca.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/SMHM-Rob-Schell-279x279.jpg">
         <h4>Salt Marsh Harvest Mouse: Southern subspecies
       Reithrodontomys raviventris. Also known as "Red-bellied Harvest Mouse”</h4>
           <p>The Salt Marsh Harvest Mouse, a federal endangered species, is a small rodent native to the San Francisco Bay Area. Distinguishing it from its white-bellied northern brothers, the southern subspecies of the harvest mouse is characterized by grooved teeth, dark brown fur, and a cinnamon-colored belly. As the name implies, the mouse lives amongst thick salt marsh vegetation, particularly <a herf="https://jsfiddle.net/Banana_Turtle/fkwbLhyf/1/">pickleweed</a>
 <!-- CHANGE THIS WHEN THE TIMES COMES-->(Salicornia), which is both its main food source and favored habitat. As well as food, these plants act as critical protection from predators for the cover-dependent mice. The Salt Marsh Mouse’s population is currently being threatened by habitat loss due to human land development, rise in sea level, and on a smaller scale, the invasive plant cordgrass(Spartina) as it replaces many of the plants native to California’s estuaries.</p>
       
      <ul>
       <h4>Quick Facts:</h4>
         <li>Length: 2.75-3.0 inches </li>
         <li>Weight: 0.3-0.5 ounces </li>
         <li>Lifespan: 8-12 months</li>
         <li>Diet:  Grass, seeds, and flowering plants such as pickleweed weed and salt grass. Fresh grass is eaten during the winter. </li>
         <li>Predators: Snakes, owls, hawks, red fox, skunks, cats</li>
         <li>Nests: Loose clumps of grass upon the surface of the ground</li>
         <li>Primarily nocturnal, they may also be seen at sunset.</li>
         <li>Possess superior ability in swimming, floating, and climbing; this allows them to survive the tidal floods that occur regularly in their native habitats.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The southern subspecies of the Salt Marsh Mouse lives in the southern and southeastern shore of the San Francisco Bay ,namely the San Mateo, Alameda, Santa Clara counties. It drinks freshwater and saltwater alike, for it has the ability to thrive solely on either. <!-- Jane will do this--></p>
